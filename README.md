# ETB Rocket
Im rly tired so i aint writing a long ahh readme for this. Ill do it in the future, for now ill just make some base UI stuff so i can get hype from the guys on the ds while i learn rust.

# Building the app by yourself
Step 1: Download repo

Step 2: Install Rust, NodeJS (comes with NPM) and PNPM

Step 3: Open the terminal in the repo's root and run "pnpm i"

Step 4: In the terminal type "pnpm tauri build"

Then you'll suffer for my shitty code but it should build the app, for any questions ask on Discord or make an Issue
(You might need to disable the antivirus to build, check tauri's ds for an exaplanation)
